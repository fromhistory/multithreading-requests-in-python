# Timestamp API

- The program takes a list of timestamps and sends an API call 
at each of the timestamps accurate down to the second based on the time at your local machine.

- If multiple timestamps are at the same time, the API calls are sent at the same time.

- The program uses multithreading to send concurrent API calls.
- Imported frameworks: time, datetime, requests, threading 

# Usage 

- Run this program in your development tool: PyCharm, VSC, Jupiter Notebook, etc.
- Python 3
